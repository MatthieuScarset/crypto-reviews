# Crypto Reviews

## Presentation 

This projects is a decentralized application to let business owners request reviews from their customers.

Stored on a blockchain, reviews are immutable. 

They contain verifiable references to a real transaction between a business and a customer.

Reviews are private by default and can be made public by the business owner.

To avoid *fake* reviews, transaction fees are supported by the business owner.

To improve feedback rate, customers are rewarded after creating reviews.
